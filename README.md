# GitHub Archives to PostgreSQL

Author: ≈Åukasz Gryglicki <lukaszgryglick@o2.pl>

This tools filters GitHub archive for given date period and given organization, repository and saves results into JSON files.

Usage:

`./gha2pg.rb YYYY-MM-DD HH YYYY-MM-DD HH [org [repo]]`

First two parameters are date from:
- YYYY-MM-DD
- HH

Next two parameters are date to:
- YYYY-MM-DD
- HH

Both next two parameters are optional:
- org (if given and non empty '' then only return JSONs matching given org). You can also provide a comma separated list of orgs here: 'org1,org2,org3'.
- repo (if given and non empty '' then only return JSONs matching given repo). You can also provide a comma separated list of repos here: 'repo1,repo2'.

Org/Repo filtering:
- You can filter only by org by passing for example 'kubernetes' for org and '' for repo or skipping repo.
- You can filter only by repo, You need to pass '' as org and then repo name.
- You can return all JSONs by skipping both params.
- You can provide both to observe only events from given org/repo.

# Configuration

You can tweak `gha2pg.rb` by:

- Set `GHA2PG_ST` environment variable to run single threaded version
- Set `GHA2PG_JSON` to save single events JSONs in `jsons/` directory
- Set `GHA2PG_NODB` to skip PostgreSQL processing at all (if `GHA2PG_JSON` not set it will parse all data from GHA, but do nothing with it)
- Set `GHA2PG_DEBUG` set to 1 to see output for all events generated, set to 2 to see all SQL query parameters

Examples in this shell script (some commented out, some not):

`time PG_PASS=your_pass ./gha2pg.sh`

# Informations

GitHub archives keeps data as Gzipped JSONs for each hour (24 gzipped JSONs per day).
Single JSON is not a real JSON file, but "\n" newline separated list of JSONs for each GitHub event in that hour.
So this is a JSON array in reality.

We download this gzipped JSON, process it on the fly, creating array of JSON events and
then each single event JSON matching org/repo criteria is saved in `jsons` directory as
`N_ID.json` where:
- N - given GitHub archive''s JSON hour as UNIX timestamp
- ID - GitHub event ID

Once saved, You can review those JSONs manually (they''re pretty printed)

# Mutithreading

For example <http://cncftest.io> server has 48 CPU cores.
It will just process 48 hours in parallel.
It detects number of available CPUs automatically.

# Results

JSON:

Usually there are about 25000 GitHub events in single hour in Jan 2017 (for July 2017 it is 40000).
Average seems to be from 15000 to 60000.

1) Running this program on a 5 days of data with org `kubernetes` (and no repo set - which means all kubernetes repos):
- Takes: 10 minutes 50 seconds.
- Generates 12002 JSONs in `jsons/` directory with summary size 165 Mb (each JSON is a single GitHub event).
- To do so it processes about 21 Gb of data.
- XZipped file: `results/k8s_5days_jsons.tar.xz`.

2) Running this program 1 month of data with org `kubernetes` (and no repo set - which means all kubernetes repos).
June 2017:
- Takes: 61 minutes 26 seconds.
- Generates 60773 JSONs in `jsons/` directory with summary size 815 Mb.
- To do so it processes about 126 Gb of data.
- XZipped file: `results/k8s_month_jsons.tar.xz`.

3) Running this program 3 hours of data with no filters.
2017-07-05 hours: 18, 19, 20:
- Takes: 55 seconds.
- Generates 168683 JSONs in `jsons/` directory with summary size 1.1 Gb.
- To do so it processes about 126 Gb of data.
- XZipped file: `results/all_3hours_jsons.tar.xz`.

Taking all events from single day is 5 minutes 50 seconds (2017-07-28):
- Generates 1194599 JSON files (1.2M)
- Takes 7 Gb of disck space

PostgreSQL:

1) Running on all 3 orgs `kubernetes,kubernetes-client,kubernetes-incubator` repos for June 2017 yields:

# PostgreSQL database
Setup:

Ubuntu like Linux:

- apt-get install postgresql 
- sudo -i -u postgres
- psql
- create database gha;
- create user gha_admin with password 'your_password_here';
- grant all privileges on database "gha" to gha_admin;
- ./structure.rb
- psql gha

`structure.rb` script is used to create Postgres database schema.
It gets connection details from environmental variables and falls back to some defaults.

Defaults are:
- Database host: environment variable PG_HOST or `localhost`
- Database port: PG_PORT or 5432
- Database name: PG_DB or 'gha'
- Database user: PG_USER or 'gha_admin'
- Database password: PG_PASS || 'password'
- If You want it to generate database indexes set `GHA2PG_INDEX` environment variable
- If You want to skip table creations set `GHA2PG_SKIPTABLE` environment variable (when `GHA2PG_INDEX` also set, it will create indexes on already existing table structure, possibly already populated)
- If You want to skip creating DB tools (like views and functions), use `GHA2PG_SKIPTOOLS` environment variable.

Recommended run is to create structure without indexes first (the default), then get data from GHA and populate array, and finally add indexes. To do do:
- `time PG_PASS=your_password ./structure.rb`
- `time PG_PASS=your_password ./gha2pg.sh`
- `time GHA2PG_SKIPTABLE=1 GHA2PG_INDEX=1 PG_PASS=your_password ./structure.rb` (will take some time to generate indexes on populated database)

Typical internal usage: 
`time GHA2PG_INDEX=1 PG_PASS=your_password ./structure.rb`

Alternatively You can use `structure.sql` to create database structure.

# Database structure

You can see database structure in `structure.rb` or `structure.sql`.

Main idea is that we divide tables into 2 groups:
- const: meaning that data in this table is not changing in time (is saved onece)
- variable: meaning that data in those tables can change between GH events, and GH event_id is a part of this tables primary keys.

List of tables:
- `gha_actors`: const, users table
- `gha_assets`: variable, assets
- `gha_branches`: varbiable, branches data
- `gha_comments`: const, comments (issue, PR, review)
- `gha_commits`: variable, commits
- `gha_events`: const, single GitHub archive event
- `gha_events_commits`: variable, event's commits
- `gha_events_pages`: variable, event's pages
- `gha_forkees`: variable, forkee, repo state
- `gha_issues`: variable, issues
- `gha_issues_assignees`: variable, issue assignees
- `gha_issues_labels`: variable, issue labels
- `gha_labels`: const, labels
- `gha_milestones`: variable, milestones
- `gha_orgs`: const, orgs
- `gha_pages`: variable, pages
- `gha_payloads`: const, event payloads
- `gha_pull_requests`: variable, pull requests
- `gha_pull_requests_assignees`: variable pull request assignees
- `gha_pull_requests_requested_reviewers`: variable, pull request requested reviewers
- `gha_releases`: variable, releases
- `gha_releases_assets`: variable, release assets
- `gha_repos`: const, repos

# JSON structure analysis tool
There is also an internal tool: `analysis.rb`/`analysis.sh` to figure out how to create psql tables for gha.
But this is only useful while developing this tool.

This tool can generate all possible distinct structures of any key at any depths, to see possible veriants of this key.
It is used very intensively during development of PSQL table structure.

# Running on Kubernetes

Kubernetes consists of 3 different orgs, so to gather data for Kubernetes You need to provide them comma separated.

For example June 2017:

`time PG_PASS=pwd ./gha2pg.rb 2017-06-01 0 2017-07-01 0 'kubernetes,kubernetes-incubator,kubernetes-client'`

# Metrics tool
There is also a tool `runq.rb`. It is used to compute metrics saved is `sql` files.

Example metrics are in `./sql/` directory.

This tool takes single parameter - sql file name.
Database uses materialized view for speedup metrics processing.
If You updated database since last run then please set `GHA2PG_REFRESH` environment variable to rebuild views.

Typical usages:

- `time PG_PASS='password' ./runq.rb sql_metrics/metric.sql`
- `time GHA2PG_REFRESH=1 PG_PASS='password' ./runq.rb sql_metrics/other_metric.sql`
